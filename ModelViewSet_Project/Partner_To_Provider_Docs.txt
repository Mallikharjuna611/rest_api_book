Q) How do TWO different kind of applications will  Communicte to each other  ??????


 figuure :       
       Partner appln  ------------http req-------------------------------->>>>Django appln
       Partner appln  <<<------------json resp--------------------------------Django appln
             |
             |
        Java or Python applns

Here My partner application will send the http request to my Django application,. Then My partner application will get back response as Json format.

so, here My partner application is Python application , and provider is Django application. So both are different applications. So they don't understand the json data directly.

here json data return by Django  and useing  by the Python.


Q) What is the way for communication ? How we can do that ?


----->> For that you need to take one Scripts file for python code.
----->> We can take the Script  file at Any locations you want. 

for example ---->> Project level or  at some other drive locations.

----->> create one file as "test.py" under project level.

Steps  to sending request from Partner to Provider :
======       ===========          ===============
1) from Partner application i will send http requuest.
2) json data i will get back into python.
3) Now I will convert this json data into Dict data type by using  ---->>> json()
4) Now  I can use that Dict data in my  Python.
             

Note :-->> For sending the http request from Python application , we need one  special module called ----                                    "requests".
	so we need to install it by using pip command
	cmd > pip install requests

so now , we will send http requests from python application. 
Inside Script file i.e, test.py , we need these steps.



Steps to Partner Code :
=====    =============
1) import requests module
	import requests

2) if you want to send the get requests , then we do first as
     2.1 ) create one BASE_URL  
	BASE_URL  = 'http://127.0.0.1:8000/'
		 
     2.2) cretate one ENDPOINT url
	ENDPOINT  = 'empdata/'

3) Merging the both URLS like  
            FINAL_URL =  BASE_URL  + ENDPOINT
          
4) Now I have to send this  url to request module methods like get,post...
	 requests.get(  FINAL_URL  )

5) Now I will get some response back  and  assigns this rsponse in to one veriable .
	resp = requests.get(  FINAL_URL  )


Q) What response I will get in resp variable ?
  
6) variable "resp" contains Json data only.

7) By using  .json() , we will converting this json data into python dict type.
          ex :   resp.json()    ------>>> no need of loads() here.It works in django.

8) print this one, then you will get output.


Q) Now with us how many application are there ? 
        two ,  1 ) python  2)  django


Execution process:
=======    ======
now for executing the python application ---->> go to command prompt ----->> goto your script file location.
that is  test.py file location.

cmd- with python file location >  python test.py ---->>enter

you will get out put as 

{  'eno' : 100 , 'ename' : 'Ramu' , 'esal' : 1000 , 'eaddr' : 'Hyd' }



Q) Who provided this response ?
	Django will provided this response to the python application.


----->> After calling the json() with resp variable then the type is Dictionary.
------>> otherwise it has http response only
