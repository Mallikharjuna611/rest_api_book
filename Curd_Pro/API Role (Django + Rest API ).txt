                                  Django  To REST-API   Intigration :
                                   ======       ========    ========


API Role :
=======
In Django , we developed some projects like Curd operation projects and Hyd jobs Info .

I want to use this application from my mobile app. Then you are saying sorry  I am not having any API to get jobs data of hyd. 

Then immediatly this mobile appln user can choose another django appln.

java appln  person coming , asking I want your hyd jobs data to use in my java app. Can you please provide ? do you have any API ?

Then you are telling sorry man , I dont have any API for my Appln. If you want to see my Jobs Information , then open a browser and send a request to my appln  then now I want to display only Hyd jobs info for you.

Drawback:
-------------
So 3rd party persions can not use Your Applications (API's.) So your app is not getting the more Popularity.

I want to provide API's for this web applications . so that applications can be used by all the 3rd party applications.


How I can do that ?
  =====   =======
For our applcation purpose ,we have models.py , views.py ,  urls.py  , .... we are using. So dont touch application files for  your API's developing.

In your django project, inside settings.py file ,  we add  "rest_framework" app.  

Inside  our appln name  create one separate folder as   "api".

Inside this "api" ,your API's related all files you need to store. 

For API's ,  views.py , urls.py and  serializers.py file we are using. But models.py file  already we created in our appln. so no need of models.py separately.

In side  "api" folder create files like bellow,
=====   =========  =========

Step :  Create serializers.py file under  "api"  folder  like  testapp.api.serializers
Step :  Create views.py file under  "api"  folder  like  testapp.api.vies
Step :  Create urls.py file under  "api"  folder  like  testapp.api.urls


serializers.py
==========
from rest_framework.serializers import ModelSerializer
from testapp.models import Emp

class EmpSerializer(ModelSerializer):
    class Meta:
        model = Emp
        fields = '__all__'


view.py
=====
from rest_framework import viewsets
from testapp.models import Emp
from testapp.api.serializers import EmpSerializer

class Rest_EmpViewSet(viewsets.ModelViewSet):
        queryset = Emp.objects.all()
        serializer_class = EmpSerializer



 urls.py
======
from django.conf.urls import url,include
from testapp.api import views

from rest_framework import routers
router = routers.DefaultRouter()
router.register('emp',views.Rest_EmpViewSet)

urlpatterns = [
    url(r'',include(router.urls)),
]


Open Project urls.py :
====  =====  =======
Provide link between  api  urls.py  file to project urls.py   like  

url(r'^api/', include('testapp.api.urls')),

----- > Ececute  makemigrations  and  migrate  and  runserver.
